        <h3>Easy Tortilla Pizza</h3>
        <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>

        <h3>Mexican Pizza</h3>
        <p>This Mexican pizza recipe layers my specially seasoned ground beef and refried beans between two crisp tortillas. Top with salsa, cheese, tomatoes, and jalape√±o for incredible flavor in every bite!</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We woke up one morning covered in flour and pepperoni grease, realizing we'd dreamt up enough pizza magic to fill a library (or an extra-large pie). Thus, Odin Recipes was born, a digital dough-main where we share our obsession with all things crust, cheese, and toppings - so fire up your ovens, because the pizza gods have spoken!</p>
