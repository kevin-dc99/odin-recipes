    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon light corn syrup</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Add the butter and stir until melted; let cool until lukewarm.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk mixture. Add the sugar, 3 cups of flour, salt and eggs; stir well to combine. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 10x 14 inch rectangle. Lightly brush the far edge with water. In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkle over the rectangles. Then sprinkle the raisins and chopped nuts over the dough. Roll up the dough into a log and seal the seam.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan, or 12 inch deep dish pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to rise overnight.</li>
        <li>The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Take the rolls out of the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile, combine the corn syrup with the vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk in the powdered sugar and enough cream to make a thick glaze; set aside. Drizzle the glaze over the rolls and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
