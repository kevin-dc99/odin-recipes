    <p>These Ritz crispy treats are a magical mix of buttery crackers and buttery marshmallows, almost like a grown up version of the old school Rice Krispie treat. Sweet, salty, chewy, and a little crunchyâ€”these are indeed a bit more indulgent than the original, but so worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>80 round buttery crackers, such as Ritz crackers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) bag mini marshmallows</li>            
        <li>1 teaspoon flaky salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chocolate sprinkles, multi-colored sprinkles, or other sprinkles as desired</li>           
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush crackers finely into a medium bowl. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add marshmallows and cook, stirring constantly, until melted. Remove from heat and stir in crushed crackers.  Working quickly, coat all of the crackers with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into an 11x7-inch (3 quart) baking dish. Lightly coat the back of a spoon or hands with cooking spray and press mixture firmly and evenly into the baking dish. Alternatively, use a small sheet of wax paper to press the mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Top immediately with flaky salt and sprinkles. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature, and then refrigerate 15 minutes before cutting into 12 to 16 squares.</li>
    </ol>
